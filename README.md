The [`buf`][buf] CLI is a tool for working with [Protocol Buffers][protobuf] APIs, offering a range of features not found in the standard `protoc` compiler, including these core features:

<a id="features"></a>

- The ability to manage Protobuf assets, including [plugins] and [templates], on the [Buf Schema Registry][bsr] (BSR).
- A [linter][lint_usage] that enforces good API design choices and structure.
- A [breaking change detector][breaking_usage] that enforces compatibility at the source code or wire level.
- A [generator][generate_usage] that invokes your protoc plugins based on a configurable [template][templates].
  A [`protoc` replacement][protoc] that uses Buf's [high-performance Protobuf compiler][compiler].
- A configurable file [builder][build_usage] that produces [Images], our extension of Protobuf's native [FileDescriptorSets][filedescriptorset].

## Installation

### Homebrew

You can install `buf` using [Homebrew][brew] (macOS or Linux):

```sh
brew install bufbuild/buf/buf
```

This installs:

* The `buf`, [`protoc-gen-buf-breaking`][breaking], and [`protoc-gen-buf-lint`][lint] binaries
* Shell completion scripts for [Bash], [Fish], [Powershell], and [zsh]

### Other methods

For other installation methods, see our [official documentation][install], which covers:

* Installing `buf` on [Windows]
* Using `buf` as a [Docker image][docker]
* Installing as a [binary], from a [tarball], and from [source] through [GitHub Releases][releases]
* [Verifying] releases using a [minisign] public key

## Usage

Buf's help interface provides summaries for commands and flags:

```sh
buf --help
```

For more comprehensive usage information, consult Buf's [documentation][docs], especially these guides:

* [`buf breaking`][breaking_usage]
* [`buf build`][build_usage]
* [`buf generate`][generate_usage]
* [`buf lint`][lint_usage]
* [`buf registry`][bsr_usage] (for using the [BSR])

## CLI breaking change policy

Our policy is to _never_ make breaking changes within a version of the CLI. Now that `buf` has reached a stable version 1.0, you can expect no breaking changes until v2.0. But because we plan on never releasing a v2.0, we will likely never break the `buf` CLI.

## Goals

[Buf]'s goal is to replace the current paradigm of API development, centered around REST/JSON, with a **schema-driven** paradigm. Defining APIs using an [IDL] provides numerous benefits over REST/JSON, and [Protocol Buffers][protobuf] (or Protobuf) is by far the most stable and widely adopted IDL in the industry, and we've chosen to build on this incredibly stable foundation rather than creating a new IDL from scratch.

But despite its technical merits, actually _using_ Protobuf has been far more challenging than it needs to be. The Buf CLI and the [BSR](#the-buf-schema-registry) are the cornerstones of our effort to change that for good and to make Protobuf reliable and easy to use for service owners and clients alikeâ€”in other words, to create a **modern Protobuf ecosystem**.

While we intend to incrementally improve on the `buf` CLI and the [BSR](#the-buf-schema-registry), we're confident that the basic groundwork for such an ecosystem is _already_ in place.

## The Buf Schema Registry

The [Buf Schema Registry][bsr] (BSR) is a SaaS platform for managing your Protobuf APIs. It provides a centralized registry and a single source of truth for all of your Protobuf assets, including not just your `.proto` files but also [plugins] and code generation [templates]. Although the BSR provides an intuitive browser UI, `buf` enables you to perform most BSR-related tasks from the command line, such as [pushing] Protobuf sources to the registry and managing [users] and [repositories]. The BSR is currently in [**beta**][bsr_post].

> The BSR is purely opt-in. We've made the core [features] of the `buf` CLI available to _all_ Protobuf users.

## Next steps

Once you've installed `buf`, we recommend completing the [Tour of Buf][tour], which provides a broad but hands-on overview of the core functionality of both the CLI and the [BSR]. The tour takes about 10 minutes to complete.

After completing the tour, check out the remainder of the [docs] for your specific areas of interest and our [roadmap] to see what we have in store for the future.
